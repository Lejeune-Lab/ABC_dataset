# ABC dataset
This is the repository for codes for ML, domain generation, graph generation of Asymmetric Buckling Columns (ABC) dataset in the paper "Learning Mechanically Driven Emergent Behavior with Message Passing Neural Networks". 

Link to paper is coming soon!

The ABC data consists of spatially heterogenous beams under compression with fixed-fixed boundary conditions. The objective is to classify each column into its buckling direction. The dataset is seperated into 3 sub-datasets, each with varying geometry.

# Domain
The Domain folder contains code to generate the domain geometry for ABC dataset.
