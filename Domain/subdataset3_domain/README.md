# Subdataset 3 Codes

This directory contains code for meshing, FEA, example domain generation and ML

## Meshing (subdataset3_mesh.py)
This code generates mesh to use in FEA. 
If using the directory to run code, we recommend to download the geoemtry dataset (subdataset1_geo) and place the file here in this directory.

The code is run with the following versions:

* Python version: 3.7.7
* Gmsh version: 4.6.0

## Image generation (subdataset3_img.py)

This is the code to generate the domain geometry as an image from the files in subdataset1_geo
The code is run with the following versions:

* Python version: Any should work
* Skimage: 0.18.1
